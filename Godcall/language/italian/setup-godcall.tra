(Abjuration)

Level: 1
Sphere: Charm 
Range: 30 ft. 
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None 

The user can rejoice in this diatribe, as the song portrays the demon lord Graz'zt so badly that it exposes him to ridicule. As a result, all friendly creatures are less terrified by the demon lord's minions and are immune to fear and morale failure for the duration of the effect. The song is only available in Graz'zt's realm in the Abyss. It loses its effect in any other location.~
@103 = ~Summon Modrons~
@104 = ~Summon Modrons
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 3
Range: Line of sight of the caster
Duration: 4 turns
Casting time: 3
Area of effect: 50 foot radius
Saving throw: None

Within one round of casting this spell, the caster summons 4 Monodrone Modrons (extraplanar creatures from the outer plane of Mechanus).
The Monodrones appear anywhere within the spell's area of effect, as determined by the caster. They attack the caster's enemies to the best of their ability until the caster either orders them to stop attacking, the spell's duration expires, or the creatures are killed. These creatures do not check morale, but they will vanish when killed. If there is no opponent to fight, the Modrons can perform other services if the caster can communicate with them and they are capable of doing so physically. This spell was made famous by the mage Argramund of the Rock, whose current whereabouts are unknown.

Monodrone
Intelligence: Semi (2-4)
Armor class: 7
Hit dice: 1+1
Thac0: 19 or 20
No. of attacks: 1
Damage/attack: 1d4
XP value: 120

Combat: Monodrones are immune to illusions or magic that affect the mind, such as charm, domination, hold, paralysis, and sleep. Fear and other emotion spells are similarly ineffective against a modron, as are attacks drawing upon the Positive and Negative Energy Planes (including life-draining powers) and the abilities of Illithids and other psionic beings.~
