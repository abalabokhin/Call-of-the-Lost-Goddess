The creatures are extremely resistant to anything that would affect their movement and ability to handle due to the characteristics of their homeland. They are able to cast powerful spells that can trap or even imprison their opponents. Their breath weapon consists of a powerful shockwave that shatters both the body and the mind of their enemies, inflicting damage as well as a penalty to attack and Saving Throws.

Each of the seven portals that open from the chamber represents a particular form of forbidden desire. Hence the strange wrought-iron symbols on the walls! The snake stands for envy, the money bag for avarice. The crown could stand for arrogance, but I'm not sure. The axe is certainly the symbol of wrath and fury.

@2044 = ~The Time of Troubles
In the Year of Shadows, 1358 Dale Reckoning, Faerûn was shaken by sinister turmoil. The heavens themselves turned pale as the gods of the Forgotten Realms were forced to leave their holy halls and take the form of mortals. An era of chaos and disorder descended upon the land.

The theft of an artifact of mighty splendor derailed the course of divine destiny. So it happened that the gods became vulnerable and their powers waned. Their faithful servants, pious priests and honorable paladins, were stripped of their divine gifts as their patrons could no longer grant them power. A void of guidance and protection opened up, and the people of Faerûn found themselves abandoned in the midst of the maelstrom.

In those wild times, the gods desperately seized the chance to regain their power and free themselves from their predicament. Violent battles broke out between the gods themselves, between their followers, and between mortal factions seeking the favor of their gods. New gods rose to fill the gap, while others faded from their former glory or were destroyed.

But the world of Faerûn itself was marked by the turmoil of this time. The paths of magic were shaken, and a shadow settled over the once powerful currents. Sages and wizards struggled to fathom the mystery, and the land sank into an aura of uncertainty.
As the veils of sorrow began to lift, the gods managed to return to their divine glory. But the Time of Troubles had left its mark that would linger for a long time. Some gods, once powerful and exalted, had fallen or changed their spheres. New gods had taken their place to fill the blanks, and their names were now uttered on mortal lips.

The people of Faerûn were scarred by the experiences of the Time of Troubles. Some had changed their faiths and beliefs, while others were lost in the chaos, broken by the pain of change. Yet some found new strength and purpose by turning to the ascended gods and seeking their favor.~
@2045 = ~About the Absence of Waukeen~
@2046 = ~About the Absence of Waukeen
Written by Brother Aldric, devoted Priest of the Coinmaiden

In these dire times that have befallen Faerûn, we find ourselves facing the loss of the divine presence of our beloved Mistress of Coin. She, the radiant sun of trade, once blessed us with her presence, but has vanished as if her light had extinguished, enveloping the temple of wealth in darkness.

Oh, how we yearn for her warming radiance and the abundance she once brought into our hearts and treasuries! Her presence was an inspiration for all who served her, and her favor caused our markets to bloom like a magnificent field of flowers. Yet now, our merchants are plagued by doubt, and our storehouses stand empty, for without Waukeen's luminous presence, we drift aimlessly like ships without a compass, lost on a stormy sea.

We, the faithful followers of the Merchants' Friend, fervently pray to her, pleading for her return and seeking signs that she has not forsaken us. But the silence of the heavens speaks volumes, and our prayers seem to echo against the icy void. Despair seizes us, and we are trapped in uncertainty, wondering when Our Lady of Gold will reappear in her full glory.

We recall tales of bygone eras, when the world was shrouded in dark hours, yet the deities bestowed their blessings upon us. Hope flickers in our hearts as we are reminded of the words of the wise, that the light of divinity will always rise again to dispel the shadows.

Thus, in this book of remembrance, let us reaffirm our unwavering devotion to Waukeen, the Merchants' Friend. We honor her in our prayers, in our songs, and in our relentless pursuit of prosperity. May she hear us and once again illuminate the lands of Faerûn with her radiant presence, so that the splendor of trade and wealth fills our souls.~

@2048 = ~The Goldspires - a sanctuary of splendor and abundance
  
Outside of the bustling walls of the city of Athkatla rises a proud temple called the Goldspires, heralding the splendor and riches of Waukeen's divine rule. Like rays of sunshine reaching for the heavens, these towers rise majestically, catching the light and presenting it as a radiant testament to the favor of the goddess.

The faithful gather here to offer their prayers and sacrifices, and to seek the blessing of the Merchants' Friend. The priests, dressed in robes of precious beauty, celebrate solemn rites and bless those who strive for prosperity and success in their endeavors. The scent of incense and spices fills the air and mingles with the sounds of prayers and chants that fill the walls.

But the Goldspires are more than just a temple. They are a center of trade and support for the faithful. Trade registers are kept here, contracts are preserved and valuable information about markets and business is collected. The wisdom of merchants and traders is brought together here to guide the faithful and promote trade.

Let us praise and honor the Goldspires, for they embody the splendor and abundance that Waukeen, the divine mistress of trade, represents. May the gates of this sacred place be forever open to welcome those seeking trade and show them the way to success.~

Duration: 4 turns
Casting time: 3
Area of effect: 50 foot radius
Saving throw: None

Within one round of casting this spell, the caster summons 4 Monodrone Modrons (extraplanar creatures from the outer plane of Mechanus).
The Monodrones appear anywhere within the spell's area of effect, as determined by the caster. They attack the caster's enemies to the best of their ability until the caster either orders them to stop attacking, the spell's duration expires, or the creatures are killed. These creatures do not check morale, but they will vanish when killed. If there is no opponent to fight, the Modrons can perform other services if the caster can communicate with them and they are capable of doing so physically. This spell was made famous by the mage Argramund of the Rock, whose current whereabouts are unknown.

With a gentle bubbling sound, it collects the vital energies from its surroundings and distils them in its interior. The energies merge into a healing potion that is ready to be used by an adventurer every day.

@2138 = ~Charm of Darkness~
@2139 = ~This charm, formerly owned by the Nighthag Zhelamiss, is typical of those carried by all Nighthags. Crafted in the Gray Waste, it heals any illness of its owner and grants a +2 bonus to all Saving Throws. Nighthags use these charms to turn ethereal and invade the dreams of mortals, often suffocating their sleeping victims. The creation of such an amulet requires a month and 100 souls, making them highly valued and fiercely reclaimed if stolen. Beings of good alignment cannot use this item.

STATISTICS:

– Saving throws: +2
– Protects against disease
– Wearer can become ethereal once per day for three rounds. In this state, <PRO_HESHE> is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 or better enchantment, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. While being ethereal <PRO_HESHE> also gains 25% resistance to magic damage.

@2140 = ~Robe of the Eyes~
@2141 = ~This valuable garment looks odd, as it is adorned with numerous eyes woven from fabric and sewn onto the robe in all directions. The wearer is thus able to look at all directions simultaneously.
Astral or ethereal beings cannot be spotted with this robe. However, creatures camouflaged by spells or hidden in shadows are easily detected, making it impossible to ambush or surprise a character wearing a Robe of Eyes. The wearer of the robe is protected against all effects that cause blindness.
Finally, the robe allows the wearer to activate one of the eyepatches by using it either to investigate the surroundings or to cast a True Sight spell. By using up one of the eyes attached to the robe, a charge is spent. If there are no more eyes available to activate the spell, the wearer can continue to wear the robe, but loses the ability to use the respective spells.


STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Wearer is protected from backstabbing attacks
– Wearer is immune to blindness

Countless ages past, in a time when the veil between realms was but a whisper and arcane currents surged unbridled, the esteemed summoner Kaelarion forged the Summoner's Amulet. It was employed by Kaelarion to guide circles of mages in safely navigating the delicate pathways between planes. Yet, fate bore ill when, amidst a perilous summoning of a Glabrezu, betrayal by his own apprentice led to Kaelarion's demise. The demon, in a cruel act of reciprocity, ensnared the treacherous apprentice and the amulet, dragging both into the dark depths of the Abyss.

@2160 = ~Bottle of Styx Water~
@2161 = ~The bottle that contains the dark water of Styx appears to be a simple bottle - with no sign of its supernatural origins or its power of oblivion. 
The flask itself is made of transparent glass. Inside is an opaque, dark liquid; an obscure, jet-black water that sloshes calmly and lazily in the bottle. The water seems to swallow even the light, and it is impossible to see its bottom. This is the water of the river Styx, the river that runs through the Lower Planes. Exposure to the liquid can cause incurable amnesia, and those who drink it or come into contact with it run the risk of losing their own memories and identities.~
@2162 = ~Drum of the Abyss~
@2163 = ~The Drum of the Abyss is crafted from the very essence of the Abyss. This kettledrum, made from dark, hardened leather, features a base adorned with the severed head of a wolf, locked in a perpetual grimace of agony. Its eyes, glowing a sinister yellow, are surrounded by fur marked with twisted runes that bind it to the Abyss.

Every six days, the drum can summon the Glabrezu Belthazaar by striking it to produce a thunderous, abyssal boom. As the drum is played, the wolf’s head illuminates, and shadows coil around it, heralding Belthazaar's arrival. However, Belthazaar is cunning and willful, seeking to further his dark schemes rather than bow to any summoner’s will.

@2170 = ~Potion of Ten thousand Souls~
@2171 = ~The Potion of Ten Thousand Souls is a dark and dangerous elixir brewed by the Nighthag Zhelamiss. The bottle is deep black in color, and its interior seems to be an endless swirl of shadowy mist. It is stored in a glass vial whose surface is riddled with tiny cracks, as if barely able to withstand the immense pressure of the souls trapped inside. The vial is sealed with a silver cap engraved with strange and disturbing symbols. The potion is a dangerous source of power and knowledge. Upon consuming this elixir, the user immediately gains 10,000 experience points, which is an enormous boost to their abilities and skills. This influx of knowledge and experience can enable a character to advance and outgrow themselves in ways previously unimaginable. However, the power of the potion comes at a price. The 10,000 experience points that the user receives are not taken from nowhere. They have been extracted from the souls of ten thousand deceased people who were cruelly captured by the Nighthag and then distilled into the potion. These souls are now trapped in the elixir forever and scream silently for release. When you consume the potion, the souls and all the experiences they have had in life are absorbed into you.

It is up to each consumer to decide whether they will be plagued by a deep sense of guilt and darkness, knowing that the souls of the deceased have been sacrificed for their own power and benefit.

These traits are extremely repulsive to most inhabitants of the Realms. Good characters must pass a Saving Throw vs. Polymorph when donning the item, otherwise they will be affected by the diadem's demonic influence and shift their alignment to chaotic evil.

The diadem can only be worn by Elves and Half-elves. It is believed that the Fey'ri use this item to pull more of their elven kin to the demonic side.

Overconfident in his skills, he enlisted demonic aid to perfect the sword, which boasted formidable power and unmatched precision. However, during its first failure in combat, the sword declared itself 'Doomed Loser' and vanished, teleporting randomly across the Multiverse after its wielder's initial miss.

Since then, the sword has followed a strange pattern. It appears and then disappears as soon as its wielder misses in combat or makes a critical mistake, seeking a more 'worthy' wielder who can master the art of the sword. Since all mortals make mistakes at times, it is obvious that the blade has not yet found a wielder it will stay with. The list of former owners is as long as the enemies who have been slain with this blade. A wise warrior should consider carefully before making use of the weapon's abilities, as there is a high chance of suddenly finding <PRO_HIMHER>self without a weapon in battle if he fails.

However, coating a weapon with silver provides the advantages of iron or steel's durability, but the properties of silver when needed.
Some monsters that are immune or resistant to non-magical weapons are vulnerable to silver weapons. These include demons and devils, certain undead or even fey creatures such as nighthags.

A poem by Riven Windwalker, Bard in service of the Moonmaiden

"In endless steps that climb so high,
a staircase rises into the sky.
The moon, a light in the dark of night,
reveals secrets hidden from sight.

A dance of planes, a realm untamed,
through the night, where all's unnamed.
Each step, an echo of times of old,
tells stories with secrets yet untold.

The Infinite Staircase, a path so vast,
beckons with promises, a riddle cast.
But in the silence, in this abyssal hue,
echoes dissipate, and spirits renew.

Moon and stars, as guides so bright,
lead the traveler through endless night.
May these steps, across time and space,
lead to peace, to calm, to a better place."

@2227 = ~Verin's Notes~
@2228 = ~This scroll contains some notes that Verin apparently wrote. They are in an elegant, yet wicked-looking handwriting. A few entries catch your eye:
- 'Maretta, scheming and seductive, rules Samora with an iron hand. She hides her true intentions behind a veil of temptation and deception and will soon betray Graz'zt. Secretly pays homage to another demon lord, but which one? Orcus, mayhap?'
- 'Mefisto, the cunning town crier, knows Samora's darkest secrets. His words are like daggers, sharpened with lies and intrigue. He dances to the tune of power. But at the moment he seems loyal to Graz'zt. I told him to keep an eye out for strangers in the city looking for Graz'zt's captive. He mentioned two mortals here: A human named Gildaar and a <PRO_RACE> named <CHARNAME>. He's watching both of them and will report back to me before either becomes dangerous.'
'Margrog, the Nalfeshnee merchant, harbors the poison of betrayal in his dark eyes. Deals in souls like a butcher deals in meat. His apparent loyalty is but a veil for his selfish ambitions. Not trustworthy.'
'The captivity of Waukeen is a source of instability in Samora. We must ensure that she is kept from being freed. Our efforts are weakening her divine presence, but she is still a potential threat.'
'<CHARNAME> is of uncommon determination and strength. I should keep an eye on <PRO_HIMHER>, for <PRO_HISHER> fate could be critical to ours. Has <PRO_HESHE> arrived to free Waukeen? Or to join Maretta in snatching Graz'zt from Samora?'

The three cyclops were feared by sailors passing by the island, as they would hurl massive boulders at passing ships, sinking more than one.

One day, the three cyclops were killed by brave adventurers. They took their eyes as a trophy to claim their reward. A clever Lantan gnome named Bilgim the Skillful decided to incorporate the eyes into a magical belt to breathe new life into their unique abilities. The gnome worked on the belt for months, eventually reinforcing it with the eyes of the three cyclops and using a great deal of magic to create a belt to suit him.
